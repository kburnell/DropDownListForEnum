ASP.NET MVC has an HTML Helper DropDownListFor that takes an IEnumerable and creates a drop down list for it.  Often you want to create a drop down list for an Enum.  Of course you can do this without using an HTML Helper and use standard HTML controls but you don’t have the standard clean view code that HTML Helpers give you.  Extending and creating your own HTML Helpers is rather easy, as demonstrated in my last post. With that in mind I created an extension to DropDownListFor that will create a drop down list for an Enum type.
